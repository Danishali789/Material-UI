          Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has
          roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over
          2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney
          College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words,
          consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of
          the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. <br><br> Lorem
          Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et
          Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This
          book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the
          Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit
          amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32. <br><br>
